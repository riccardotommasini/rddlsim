Implements a parser, simulator, and client/server evaluation architecture for the relational dynamic influence diagram language (RDDL) -- pronounced "riddle".  RDDL is intended to compactly support the representation of a wide range of relational MDPs and POMDPs and support the efficient simulation of these domains.  RDDL is used in a number of past and present International Probabilistic Planning Competitions (IPPCs):

  * [IPPC 2011 (Discrete)](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/IPPC_2011/)
  * [IPPC 2014 (Discrete)](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mgrzes/IPPC_2014/)
  * [IPPC 2015 (Continuous)](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/IPPC_2014/)
